Create the Collection Student_Data( Student _ID, Student _Name, Department, Marks )and solve the
following:
1. Display all Students based on their departments along with an average Marks of a particular
department.
2. Displays the number of Students associated along with a particular department.
3. Display list of Students with the highest Marks in each Department in descending order
of Marks.
4. Create an index on field Student_ID.
5. Create an index on fields “Student_Name‘ and “Department”.
6. Drop an index on field Student_ID.
7. Drop an index on fields “Student_Name‘ and “Department”.
