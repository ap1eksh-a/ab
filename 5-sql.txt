WHERE (Type = 'Double' OR Type = 'Family') AND Price < 40.00
ORDER BY Price ASC;
How many different guests have made bookings for August?

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT GuestNo) AS guest_count
FROM Booking
WHERE MONTH(DateFrom) = 8;
What is the total income from bookings for the Grosvenor Hotel today?

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(r.Price) AS total_income
FROM Booking b
JOIN Room r ON b.RoomNo = r.RoomNo AND b.HotelNo = r.HotelNo
JOIN Hotel h ON r.HotelNo = h.HotelNo
WHERE h.Name = 'Grosvenor Hotel'
  AND CURDATE() BETWEEN b.DateFrom AND b.DateTo;
What is the most commonly booked room type for each hotel in London?

sql
Copy code
SELECT h.HotelNo, r.Type, COUNT(*) AS booking_count
