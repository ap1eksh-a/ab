Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) GuestNo is primary key
Room contains room details for each hotel and (HotelNo, RoomNo) forms the
primary key.Booking contains details of the bookings and the primary key comprises

sql
Copy code
SELECT h.HotelNo, h.Name, COUNT(r.RoomNo) AS room_count
FROM Hotel h
JOIN Room r ON h.HotelNo = r.HotelNo
WHERE h.City = 'London'
